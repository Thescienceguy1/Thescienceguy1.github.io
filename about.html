  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, my name is Isaac Ceballos. I'm a community college student majoring in mechanical engineering with a strong interest in astronomy, astrophysics, and aerospace technology.</p>

  <p>I work on hands-on projects that combine engineering and space science. These include building autonomous robots, LiDAR scanning systems, and conducting research on stellar activity like flares from red dwarf stars. I've also explored lunar rover design and developed sensor-based systems for mapping and data collection.</p>

  <p>To organize and share my work, I created <strong>RetroSkies Lab (RSL)</strong>, a personal startup and online platform where I archive and publish all my projects. RSL is meant to be a home for my research, technical experiments, and creative engineering ideas. Whether it's documenting astrophysics findings or prototyping a system, I use RSL to keep everything in one place.</p>

  <p>This website is the official space for my ongoing journey in engineering, science, and exploration. Thanks for visiting and taking an interest in what I do.</p>
