  <h1>EV Lac Observation Summary</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>June 24</h2>
    <img src="light_curve_june_24.png" alt="EV Lac Light Curve - June 24">
    <p class="description">The light curve for June 24 shows relatively stable brightness across the observing window. No significant flare activity was observed, indicating a quiet stellar period.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>June 28</h2>
    <img src="light_curve_june_28.png" alt="EV Lac Light Curve - June 28">
    <p class="description">On June 28, we see minor fluctuations that may be attributed to noise or subtle stellar variability. No clear flare signature is evident.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>June 29</h2>
    <img src="light_curve_june_29.png" alt="EV Lac Light Curve - June 29">
    <p class="description">June 29 shows a brief dip followed by a recovery, which could hint at a minor flare or instrumental change. Additional nights help verify this.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>July 1</h2>
    <img src="light_curve_july_1.png" alt="EV Lac Light Curve - July 1">
    <p class="description">The light curve on July 1 is more dynamic. A mild downward spike may suggest a small flare, but the overall pattern remains consistent.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>July 3</h2>
    <img src="light_curve_july_3.png" alt="EV Lac Light Curve - July 3">
    <p class="description">July 3 shows a clear flare event occurring near the middle of the session. The sharp magnitude change followed by gradual decay fits the flare profile.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>July 4</h2>
    <img src="light_curve_july_4.png" alt="EV Lac Light Curve - July 4">
    <p class="description">Data from July 4 contains a visible gap, likely due to interrupted recording. However, the earlier section suggests steady brightness before the drop-off.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>July 5</h2>
    <img src="light_curve_july_5.png" alt="EV Lac Light Curve - July 5">
    <p class="description">July 5 shows another minor flare candidate with a smooth brightness increase and tapering decline. This aligns with low-energy flare behavior.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>July 6</h2>
    <img src="light_curve_july_6.png" alt="EV Lac Light Curve - July 6">
    <p class="description">July 6 features a subtle rise and fall in brightness. The light curve is noisy but may contain a flare just above the detection threshold.</p>
